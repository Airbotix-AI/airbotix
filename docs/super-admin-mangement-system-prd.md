## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

---

## üìã Product Overview

### What We're Building
A web-based admin dashboard for Airbotix internal staff to manage educational operations: content, users, students, workshops, courses, and teachers. This replaces current spreadsheet-based workflows with a centralized management system.

### Current Pain Points
- Workshop content scattered across Google Drive folders
- Student enrollment managed via Excel sheets
- Teacher scheduling through WhatsApp, WeChat and email coordination
- Course materials inconsistently organized
- No unified user access control system

### Success Goals
- Centralize all educational content in one searchable system
- Streamline workshop booking and teacher assignment workflow
- Maintain comprehensive student records and progress tracking
- Standardize course delivery across all programs

### Module 2: Identity & Access Management (IAM + RBAC)
**Purpose**: Secure user authentication with role-based access and basic change tracking

**User Roles & Permissions:**
- **Super Admin**: Full system access - can create/edit/delete all content
- **Content Manager**: CMS and courses (full access), other modules (read-only)
- **Operations Coordinator**: Students, workshops, teachers (full access), CMS (read-only)
- **Teacher**: Assigned workshops only (read), student progress (update only)

**Core Functions:**
- **User Authentication**: Supabase Auth with email magic links

**Data Protection:**
Given the educational context involving student information, minimal change tracking is essential:
- **Student Updates**: Log who modified student records and when
- **Workshop Changes**: Track capacity and enrollment modifications  
- **Critical Actions**: Record user actions affecting student safety or privacy

**Implementation**: Use simple `change_logs` table with user_id, table_name, record_id, action, and timestamp. This provides accountability without full audit complexity.
